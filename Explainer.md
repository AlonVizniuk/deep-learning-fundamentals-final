## 🤖 Explainer (a.k.a. How Not to Break Things)

Wanna run the code without crying? Follow these magical steps:

1. **Too Lazy to Code?**  
   No worries — just run the notebooks in **Google Colab**.  
   They’re almost independent, like your favorite indie band.  
   No specific order, no drama, just run the transfer_learning before the image_retrieval.

2. **The Sacred File:**  
   Upload `stanford_cars_with_class_names.xlsx` to your Google Drive.  
   Then grab its file ID like a treasure hunter and paste it in the `gdown` cell of each notebook. Boom, data access unlocked.

3. **Saving Stuff? Don't Ghost It.**  
   Some cells save files to your Drive.  
   Remember to copy the file ID after saving or you’ll be like “Where did my model go?”

4. **Run Like the Wind:**  
   Execute the cells top to bottom — one at a time.  
   Trust the process. Enjoy the ride. 🍿

5. **Bonus Level – The Report:**  
   I wrote a cool **Project Report** too.  
   It has charts, insights, and zero AI hallucinations (I hope). Give it a read!

May your runtime be fast and your loss always decreasing.
