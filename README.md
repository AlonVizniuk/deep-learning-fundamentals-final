## 🤖 README (a.k.a. How Not to Break Things)

Wanna run the code without crying? Follow these magical steps:

1. **Too Lazy to Code?**  
   No worries — just run the notebooks in **Google Colab**.  
   They’re almost independent, like your favorite indie band.  
   No specific order, no drama — just make sure to run `transfer_learning` before `image_retrieval`.

2. **The Sacred File:**  
   Upload `stanford_cars_with_class_names.xlsx` to your Google Drive.  
   Then grab its file ID like a treasure hunter and paste it in the `gdown` cell of each notebook. Boom, data access unlocked.

3. **Saving Stuff? Don't Ghost It.**  
   Some cells save files to your Drive.  
   Remember to copy the file ID after saving or you’ll be like “Where did my model go?”

4. **Run Like the Wind:**  
   Execute the cells top to bottom — one at a time.  
   Trust the process. Enjoy the ride. 🍿

5. **Bonus Level – The Report:**  
   I wrote a cool **Project Report** too.  
   It has charts, insights, and zero AI hallucinations (I hope). Give it a read!

6. **Oops? `#%%script echo Skipping` Appears?**  
   If you see any random `#%%script echo Skipping` lines in the notebook…  
   **No panic!** Just make sure they’re commented out — or delete them.  
   They’re leftovers from development, like pizza crusts but less tasty.

May your runtime be fast and your loss always decreasing.
